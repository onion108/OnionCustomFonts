# Oniosevka Font

Oniosevka font is a custom build of [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka) that fits my use and my aesthetic opinions.
This repository includes pre-built Oniosevka fonts, the custom Iosevka build configuration (so you can build by yourself), and the Oniosevka with Nerd Font patched.

Building Iosevka made my MacBook Pro very hot. The fan had complained about that. Fortunately it finally completed.
About how to use the `private-build-plans.toml` to build your own version, read [Building Iosevka From Source](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka/blob/main/doc/custom-build.md).
